## Introduction

This blog post series isn't a thing I normally do, this will be more like a journey that I document during development of my project [Nidhogg](https://github.com/idov31/Nidhogg). In this series of blogs (which I don't know how long will it be) I'll write about difficulties I encountered while I'm developing Nidhogg and tips & tricks to everyone that wants to start creating a stable kernel mode driver in 2022.

This series will be about WDM type of kernel drivers, developing in VS2019. To install it, you can follow the guide in [MSDN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk). I highly recommend for you to test EVERYTHING in a virtual machine to avoid crashing your own computer.

Without further delays - Let's start!

## Kernel Drivers In 2022

The first question you might ask yourself is: How can kernel driver help me in 2022? There are a lot of 1337 things that I can do in the usermode without the pain of developing and constistenly crash my computer.

From a red team perspective, I think that there are several things that a kernel driver can give that usermode can't.

* Being an effecient backdoor with extremely evasive pesistency.
* Do highly privileged operation without the dependecy of LPE exploit or privileged user.
* Easily evade AV / EDR hooks.
* Be able to hide your implant without suspicious usermode hooks.

From a blue team perspective, you can log more events and block suspicious operations with methods you won't be able to do in the usermode.

* Create a driver to monitor and log specific events (like [Sysmon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon)) specially crafted to meet your organization needs.
* Create kernel mode hooks to find advanced rootkits and malwares.
* Provide kernel mode protection to your blue agents (such as OSQuery, Wazuh, etc.).

**NOTE: This blog series will focus more on the red team part but I'll also add blue team perspective as one affects the other.**

## Basic driver structure

Like any good programmer, we will start with creating a basic driver to print the famous words with explanation about the basics.

```cpp
#include <ntddk.h>

extern "C"
NTSTATUS DriverEntry(PDRIVER_OBJECT DriverObject, PUNICODE_STRING RegistryPath) {
    UNREFERENCED_PARAMETER(RegistryPath);
    DriverObject->DriverUnload = MyUnload;
    KdPrint(("Hello World!\n"));
    return STATUS_SUCCESS;
}

void MyUnload(PDRIVER_OBJECT DriverObject) {
    UNREFERENCED_PARAMETER(DriverObject);
    KdPrint(("Goodbye World!\n"));
}
```

This simple driver will print "Hello World!" and "Goodbye World!" when it's loaded and unloaded. Since the paramter RegistryPath is not used, we can use UNREFERENCED_PARAMETER to optimize the variable out.

Every driver needs to implement at least two of the functions methioned above.

The DriverEntry is the first function that is called when the driver is loaded and it is very much like the main function for usermode programs, except it gets two parameters:

* DriverObject: A pointer to the driver object.
* RegistryPath: A pointer to a UNICODE_STRING structure that contains the path to the driver's registry key.

The DriverObject is an important object that will serve us a lot in the future, its definition is:

```cpp
typedef struct _DRIVER_OBJECT {
  CSHORT             Type;
  CSHORT             Size;
  PDEVICE_OBJECT     DeviceObject;
  ULONG              Flags;
  PVOID              DriverStart;
  ULONG              DriverSize;
  PVOID              DriverSection;
  PDRIVER_EXTENSION  DriverExtension;
  UNICODE_STRING     DriverName;
  PUNICODE_STRING    HardwareDatabase;
  PFAST_IO_DISPATCH  FastIoDispatch;
  PDRIVER_INITIALIZE DriverInit;
  PDRIVER_STARTIO    DriverStartIo;
  PDRIVER_UNLOAD     DriverUnload;
  PDRIVER_DISPATCH   MajorFunction[IRP_MJ_MAXIMUM_FUNCTION + 1];
} DRIVER_OBJECT, *PDRIVER_OBJECT;
```

But I'd like to focus on the MajorFunction: This is an array of an important functions that the driver can implement for IO management in different ways (direct or with ioctls), handling IRPs and more.

We will use it for the next part of the series but for now keep it in mind. (A little tip: Whenever you encounter a driver and you want to know what it is doing make sure to check out the functions inside the MajorFunction array).

To finish the most basic initialization you will need to do one more thing - define the DriverUnload function. This function will be responsible to stop callbacks and free any memory that was allocated.

When you finish your driver initialization you need to return a NT_STATUS code, this code will be used to determine if the driver will be loaded or not.

## Testing a driver

If you tried to copy & paste and run the code above, you might have noticed that it's not working.

By default, windows does not allow to load self-signed drivers, and surely not unsigned drivers, this was created to make sure that a user won't load a malicious driver and by that give to an attacker
even more persistence and privileges on the attacked machine.

Luckily, there is a way to bypass this restriction for testing purposes, to do this run the following command from an elevated cmd:

```bat
bcdedit /set testsigning on
```

After that restart your computer and you should be able to load the driver.

To test it out, you can use [Dbgview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/debugview) to see the output (don't forget to compile to debug to see the KdPrint's output).
To load the driver, you can use the following command:

```bat
sc create DriverName type= kernel binPath= C:\Path\To\Driver.sys
sc start DriverName 
```

And to unload it:

```bat
sc stop DriverName
```

You might ask yourself now, so how an attacker can deploy a driver? This can be done in several ways:

* The attacker has found / generated a certificate (expiration date doesn't matter).
* The attacker has allowed testsigning (just like we did now).
* The attacker has a vulnerable driver with 1day that allows to load drivers.
* The attacker has a zero day that allows to load drivers.

Just not so long ago when [Nvidia was breached](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/nvidia-data-breach-exposed-credentials-of-over-71-000-employees/) a signature was leaked and used by [threat actors](https://securityonline.info/nvidias-leaked-code-signing-certificate-is-used-by-hackers-to-sign-malware/).

## Resources

When we will continue to dive into the series, I will use a lot of references from the following amazing resources:

* Windows Kernel Programming.
* Windows Internals Part 7.
* MSDN (I know I said amazing, I lied here).

And you can check out the following repositories for drivers examples:

* [Windows Kernel Programming's Examples](https://github.com/zodiacon/windowskernelprogrammingbook)
* [Microsoft's Example Drivers](https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-driver-samples)

## Conclusion

This blog post is maybe short but is the start of the coming series of blog posts about kernel drivers and rootkits specifically. Another one, more detailed, will come out soon!
