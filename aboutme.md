My name is Ido Veltzman, I'm 21 years old, programming for 7+ years and in the cybersecurity field for 4+ years.
I love to find new ways to break a software and that what you'll see mostly in this blog post.
My top languages are:
- C++
- C
- C#
- Python
- Java
- Golang
- Rust
- PowerShell
- Nim

The thing I like the most is reverse enginering and I am currently learning how to search for vulnerabilities.
