Hey, my name is Ido Veltzman, I'm 22 years old security researcher that also loves to code, research and share my findings online.

You can find here articles about several public projects that I have done regarding injection, obfuscation and other tools to evade detection (mostly for windows os).
Other than that, you can also find here some other series like Lord Of The Ring0, or educational things like learning Rust through building ransomware.

Feel free to contact me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/idov31) or [mail](mailto:idov3110@gmail.com) regarding any of my [projects](https://github.com/idov31) or publications.

Enjoy the blog and have fun!
